    <h1><strong> GENDER STEREOTYPES </strong></h1>

    <div class="paragraph1">
      <p>Within gaming culture and especially within multi-player online games (MMOs) there has been an evident demonstration of how the patriarchal and hegemonic standards of real-life systems have colonised the digital space.</p>

    <div class="paragraph2">
      <p>Female oversexualisation occurs on an all too regular basis with charachters having exaggerated breast and butt sizes, wearing bikini armour and placed in exaggerated sexual poses.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph3">
      <p>We see strong female protagonists degraded through their over-sexualisation and completely unbelievable and impractical clothing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph4">
      <p>" To begin, many of the games neglect to include women as characters at all. Furthermore, when female chracters were depicted they were often presented as dependent upon men (such as victims) or in supporting roles to men. Women were also frequently presented as sex objects or were depicted as contributing less than men."

    </div>

    <div class="paragraph5">
      <p>Male stereotypes are similarly maintained by gaming avatars. The ‘hero type’ is a reoccuring image of muscular-builds, rugged-looks and strong facial structures. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph6">
      <p> This becomes overly exaggerated when muscles become the representation of power. More and more characters are adopting unrealistic bodies to demonstrate strength and agility, maintaining the gender stereotype of men showing aggression and having to have physical dominance. </p>

    <h1> VOICES IN THE COMMUNITY </h1>
  </div>

    <div class="paragraph7">
      <p>As the gaming community becomes more
        diverse, criticism towards the industry’s
        portrayal of characters is becoming
        more and more evident. <strong> Bikini Armour
        Battle Damage </strong> - a tumblr page - is
        dedicated to calling out oversexualisation
        and misrepresentation in gaming culture. </p>

      </div>

    <div class="paragraph8">
      <p> However, the community is still dominated
        by a cis-male audiemce which expect
        and openly demand the over-sexualisation of female characters. </p>

    <div class="paragraph9">
      <p> Within Second Life, I was bombarded with over-sexualised images of both male and female avatars. Ads for avatars demonstrated a very narrow, patriarchal vision of the ideal person. However, once
        interacting with many long-term players, I found that many felt that the avatars actually <strong> helped them explore their gender identities </strong> and through them, were empowered.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph10">
      <p> Gender expression within the digital world is constricted by the patriarchal and gender hegemonic attitutes of the real world. How that is maintained is the question. Whether,
        it is maintained through the developers, believing that their male-dominated audience demands a particular image of a woman or through the players themselves who continue to encourage such degrading
        representation - it is evident that <strong>  a change must be made </strong> to the outdated industry views.
